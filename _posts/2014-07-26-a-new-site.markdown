I have a website again!

I let my previous site hosting account lapse without keeping a backup, so
I made something new.
 
This site is generated using the very fancy [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com/)
and hosted on [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com/). The code for my
site is hosted [here on GitHub](https://github.com/chrishepner/chrishepner.github.io/).

The site uses [Zurb Foundation](http://foundation.zurb.com/) as a responsive grid framework.
(I know it's a little bit overkill for this very simple site, but  I wanted to try it out. I'm
not doing anything extraordinary with it, but it's very nice.)

Anyway, now that I have a functional website again, I'll be updating this space more frequently.
